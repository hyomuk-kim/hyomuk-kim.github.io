> Even though I moved to the AI Center to work on developing a multimodal interaction framework for "robots" and AR/VR, the project was assigned to another overseas research institute, and I had to participate in a different project. (Well, you know, life doesn't always go as planned.) My research direction was then redirected toward next-generation interactions, so while preparing a research proposal for Brain-Machine Interface studies, I also became involved in this voice command proposal project.
