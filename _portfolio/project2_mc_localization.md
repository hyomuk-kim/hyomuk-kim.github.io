### Goal

The objective of this project was to perform a comprehensive refactoring of the existing Monte Carlo Localizer module. This was done by adhering to fundamental theory and incorporating recent advancements in related algorithms, all while minimizing the use of heuristics that were originally implemented for demonstrations without thorough scrutiny.

### Needs & Approaches

* MCL Fundamental

* Odometry Profiling for Motion Model

* Beam Model Test

* KLD resampling

### Insights & Further Considerations

To be added.
