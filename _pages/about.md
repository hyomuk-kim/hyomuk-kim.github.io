Currently I am a staff software engineer at *Robot Center, [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com)* working on mobile robot navigation.  
Recently I am diving deep into visual SLAM for 3D localization, mapping, and robust navigation.  
I also endeavored to implement an optimal neural network for brain-computer interface and speech synthesis engine at *Global AI Center*.

Previously as a hardware engineer for 5 years, I have developed circuit systems of various TV models at Visual Display Division, *[Samsung Electronics](https://www.samsung.com)*, and performed a project on an user contents archive platform based on multi device interfaces as a planner and a manager, leading the 6-member team at *C-Lab*.

This website is devoted to help you understand my journey for research more well.

## Education
* B.Sc. in Electrical & Electronics Engineering, *[Chung-Ang University](https://www.cau.ac.kr)* ( *Feb 2011* )
* Cadet in the Army *[ROTC](https://www.armyofficer.mil.kr:460/)* (Reserved Officer Training Corps) program 49<sup>th</sup> ( *Mar 2009 ~ Feb 2011* )

## Research Objectives
### General Objectives
Determine how robots can understand semantic contexts of surroundings, navigate safely and fluently
in/out-door environments for various tasks and augment their intelligence by learning continuously.

### Specific Objectives
* Determine how autonomous robots and vehicles perfectly understand and navigate 3D space in the specific environments with various static and dynamic objects (wall, glass, pillar, furniture, human, etc.), using raw sensory data like images or scans from just a couple of sensors (e.g. only stereo camera), in terms of the specific constraints for feasible applications or products.

* Examine how robots adapt special environments, such as underwater, forests and even outer space for the realization of the impeccable navigation, and assess how well they navigate across different types of those environments seamlessly, utilizing the aforementioned features from the point of view of realizing the life-long navigation of versatile robots.

* Describe how robots improve their navigation ability by various types of learning, what novel learning schemes could be applied, for instance, by grafting neural radiance field, diffusion model or reinforcement learning in robot navigation, and how they expand their world (concretely map) including multi layered indoor and outdoor environments incrementally, while explaining why robotâ€™s navigation should be evolved by machine learning.
