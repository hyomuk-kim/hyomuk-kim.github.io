I am a staff engineer and roboticist at Robot Center, [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com) working on mobile robot navigation with [Mid-Eum Choi](https://linkedin.com/in/mid-eum-choi-ba106017a) and [Junghyun Kwon](https://linkedin.com/in/junghyun-kwon).

Recently I have been diving deep into **Visual Navigation** for 3D localization, mapping, and robust navigation.
I also endeavored to perform research projects on neural networks for Brain-Machine Interface advised by [Inchul Hwang](https://linkedin.com/in/inchul-hwang-76463831) and [Daniel D. Lee](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/daniel-dongyuel-lee), and Neural Speech Synthesis engine advised by [Chanwoo Kim](https://linkedin.com/in/chanwoo-kim-2628a622) at Global AI Center.

Previously, I worked as a hardware engineer for 5 years, developing circuit systems for various TV models at the Visual Display Division of [Samsung Electronics](https://www.samsung.com). Additionally, I served as a planner and manager for a year, leading a 6-member team in a project focused on a user content archive platform utilizing multi-device interfaces at [C-Lab](https://samsungclab.com/).

This website is dedicated to helping you gain a better understanding of my research journey.

## Research Objectives
### General Objectives
Explore <u>robots' ability to understand and navigate diverse environments safely</u> both indoors and outdoors when performing a variety of tasks, also considering <u>learning-based methodologies for continuous intelligence improvement</u>.

### Specific Objectives
* Assess <u>autonomous robots and vehicles' ability to navigate complex 3D environments</u> with various static and dynamic obstacles using limited sensor data like images or scans, <u>while considering practical constraints</u>.

* Develop <u>techniques to factorize scene elements from visual sensors</u>, incorporating semantic objects and diverse features, utilizing both novel neural networks and classical tracking methods. Investigate geometric parameterization for detailed 3D space representation for future planning. Explore <u>methods for integrating multiple visual and sensory inputs dynamically for adaptability</u> across varied sensor configurations to minimize geometric ambiguity.

* Discuss <u>how robots enhance navigation through diverse learning approaches</u> (such as deep reinforcement learning, imitation learning, neural SLAM, and even meta-learning), and describe their incremental expansion of semantic perception and mapping, through which emphasize <u>the importance of evolving robot navigation through continuous learning.</u>

* Evaluate <u>robots' adaptability in unique environments</u> like underwater, forests, and outer space, assessing their seamless navigation capabilities across these environments <u>to achieve long-lasting navigation for versatile robots.</u>
