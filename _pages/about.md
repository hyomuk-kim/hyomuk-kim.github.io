Hi, my name is Hyomuk Kim and I am a staff engineer at Robot Center, [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com)
working on mobile robot navigation. Recently I am diving deep into visual SLAM
for 3D localization, mapping, and robust navigation. Previously, I developed TV hardware system
at Visual Display Div., [Samsung Electronics](https://www.samsung.com), and did research on speech synthesis (Text-To-Speech)
and brain computer interface in Global AI Center, Samsung Research.
This website is devoted to my various research projects and blog.
